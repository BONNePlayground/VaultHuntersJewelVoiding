# Vault Hunters Jewel Voiding

This mod was requested by our only NotSoClutch who was tired of handling so many jewels. The primary use of this mod is to get rid of jewels with the Backpack Mod Void module by their attributes. 
However, the implementation allows us to do even more junky things with jewels, as it allows us to use ANY advanced upgrade with the NBT filter to match Jewels with 1 attribute. 

How the mod works?

You put Jewel with 1 attribute (if it has multiple, it will not work and will have the default [without mod] behavior) in the advanced upgrade slot, and click on Match NBT. 
After that upgrade will match any other jewel with the same attribute (if it is the only attribute) and and apply the module to it.

The image below shows how it works with Void Upgrade, where it is voiding 3 jewels and not allowing them to be picked up.
